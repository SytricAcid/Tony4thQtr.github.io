                This quarter has been one of the hardest yet most rewarding times of my life. Balancing schoolwork with my personal life was tough, but meeting my amazing friend group made everything feel lighter. For the first time, I truly felt like I belonged, surrounded by people who support and understand me. Their presence gave me the confidence to embrace challenges head-on, making each day at school more meaningful and exciting.

                In ICT, we tackled some of the trickiest yet most fascinating topics. Learning about pop-up boxes, functions in JavaScript, if-statements, and while loops felt overwhelming at times, but each lesson helped me build a stronger foundation in coding. The logic behind if-statements and loops took some time to grasp, but through practice and trial and error, I started seeing patterns and understanding how they worked. Despite the frustration of debugging, the feeling of finally getting my code to work was unmatched!
                <br><br>
                Looking back, I am beyond grateful for my parents, friends, and family, and my good friend Bub, who has been my constant support system. Their encouragement pushed me to keep learning even when things felt impossible. With everything Iâ€™ve learned this quarter, I feel more prepared than ever to explore new horizons and embrace the future with open arms!
